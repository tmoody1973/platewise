# Development Workflow & Feature Management

## Feature Development Process

### 1. Feature Selection
- Reference the comprehensive feature checklist (200+ features)
- Prioritize based on: ðŸ”´ Critical (MVP) â†’ ðŸŸ¡ Important â†’ ðŸŸ¢ Nice-to-Have
- Consider hackathon timeline constraints (37 days total)
- Focus on features that demonstrate Kiro IDE capabilities

### 2. Spec-Driven Development
For complex features (marked in checklist), create specs in `.kiro/specs/[feature-name]/`:
- **requirements.md**: EARS format user stories and acceptance criteria
- **design.md**: Technical architecture and cultural considerations
- **tasks.md**: Implementation checklist with specific coding tasks

### 3. Implementation Guidelines
- **Cultural First**: Every feature must consider diverse cultural backgrounds
- **Accessibility Mandatory**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all UI elements
- **Mobile Responsive**: Design for mobile-first, scale up to desktop
- **API Efficiency**: Implement caching and error handling for all external APIs
- **Offline Support**: Core features must work without internet connection

### 4. Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: >80% coverage for all business logic
- **Cultural Testing**: Validate with multiple language/cultural scenarios
- **Accessibility Testing**: Screen reader and keyboard navigation validation
- **Performance Testing**: Test on lower-end devices common in target communities

## API Integration Strategy

### Primary APIs (Critical)
1. **Supabase**: Backend database, authentication, and real-time features
2. **Kroger Catalog API**: Real-time pricing data
3. **Spoonacular API**: Recipe database and nutrition
4. **OpenAI ChatGPT-5**: AI meal planning and budget optimization

### Secondary APIs (Important)
5. **Edamam API**: Additional nutritional data
6. **ElevenLabs API**: Text-to-speech for accessibility
7. **Google Places API**: Store location and information

### Implementation Order
- Start with mock data for rapid prototyping
- Implement APIs incrementally as features require them
- Always include error handling and fallback options
- Cache API responses to improve performance and reduce costs

## Cultural Sensitivity Checklist

### Before Implementing Any Feature
- [ ] Consider impact on different cultural groups
- [ ] Avoid culturally insensitive colors (red in some contexts)
- [ ] Include appropriate cultural dietary badges (Halal, Kosher, etc.)
- [ ] Test with diverse user scenarios
- [ ] Ensure ingredient names work across cultures
- [ ] Consider religious/cultural calendar implications

### Language & Accessibility
- [ ] Support RTL languages (Arabic, Hebrew)
- [ ] Use culturally appropriate fonts (Noto Sans for broad support)
- [ ] Provide text alternatives for all icons
- [ ] Test with screen readers
- [ ] Ensure keyboard navigation works
- [ ] Support high contrast mode

## Progress Tracking
